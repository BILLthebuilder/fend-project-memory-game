# Memory Game Project
The Memory Game Project is a complete browser-based card matching game (also known as Concentration).

## How The Game Works
The game consists of sixteen "cards" arranged in a grid. The deck is made up of eight different pairs of cards, each with different symbols on one side. The cards are arranged randomly on the grid with the symbol face down. The gameplay rules are very simple: flip over two hidden cards at a time to locate the ones that match!

## On Each turn:

The player flips one card over to reveal its underlying symbol whereby there is a flipping animation.
The player then turns over a second card, trying to find the corresponding card with the same symbol.
If the cards match,there is an animation and both cards stay flipped over.
If the cards do not match, both cards are flipped face down with no animation.
The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched.

## Features of the game
A move counter
A clock that starsts each time a card is clicked.
A star rating.
Function to restart the game.
